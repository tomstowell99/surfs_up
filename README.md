## We will be presenting temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. With this information we hope to make a better informed decision about whether or not to open a Surf and Ice Cream Shop on the island.

## Analysis of June temperature data

  * The average temperature for June has been 74.9 degrees Fahrenheit
  * The standard deviation from our average of 74.9 has only been 3.2 degrees.
  * The lowest record temperature within our data was only 64 degrees.
  
  The chart below shows most of our temperatures are falling between 73 and 77 degrees in June with a standard deviation of 3.2 degrees. Our high was 85 with a low of 
  only 64.

  ## Summary
  
  The Island of Oahu looks to be a very good site for our Surf and Ice Cream Shop. As demonstrated above the temperatures for June are 
  very nice with only minor variations in temperature throughout the month. In December the it is a bit cooler but still very nice and 
  still maintaining a nice warm temperature with little variance in daily temperatures. The temperature is important but we also need 
  to look at the rain. After all. No one really wants to eat ice cream or surf in the rain.
  
  The charts below show the average rain for June and December.
  
  * For both June and December the chances of rain on any one day are almost less than 75%, and on average when it does it would be 
    for between .13(June) and .21(December) of inches on average.

   When considering the mild temperatures and high likely chance of clear skies. It looks like we have a great location to open our
   new shop.
